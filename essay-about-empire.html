                            The relationship between war and empire is one of codependency and ambivalence. An empire must expand to survive or risk being taken over by a more powerful one. It must subjugate native populations to grow, requiring the forces of war. War is expensive, complex, and ambitious, requiring the control of men and nature, technology and knowledge, society and state, all of which must be directed towards a defined end (Rafael 6-1). War installs colonial infrastructure and agents, either turning native peoples into servants of the empire or exterminating them. The long-term objective of the empire is continued expansion, which is dependent on more war.
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            However, an empire is locked in an ambivalent relationship with those under its control due to its dependence upon them. Colonies, outposts, and military branches can never be placed under complete obedience because they exist within a larger world of influence outside the reach of the empire. The intermingling of native and colonial peoples, government bureaucracy, and language barriers can affect the values of colonizers, and geographic distance can block the flow of resources, creating instability and rebellion (Rafael 1-2). War creates inherently unstable conditions that affect the people the empire depends on for continued expansion.
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            Because an empire depends on the people it subjugates, it seeks to hide its relationship's true nature by ruling in ways that create minimal friction. Therefore, empires use both <span style="font-style: italic;">embodied</span> (visible) and <span style="font-style: italic;">disembodied</span> (invisible) methods of rulership (Rafael 6-4). The United States uses economic, military, political, and cultural approaches to imperial rulership, what economist James Laxer refers to as the "pillars of the American empire" (Laxer 65).
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            Disembodied approaches of U.S. power manifest discreetly, resulting from political practices toward other nations in treaties and alliances designed to provide and ensure economic access to resources, markets, and trade control. Examples include the <span style="font-style: italic;">Monroe Doctrine</span> (the U.S. claiming sovereignty over home territories) and the <span style="font-style: italic;">International Monetary Fund</span> (IMF), which allows multinational corporations to develop leverage over lesser nations (Laxer 74). Substantial cultural power is also exerted through Hollywood movie, television, and musical exports while limiting similar cultural imports from other nations, encouraging other countries to adopt American values, products, and attitudes toward capitalism (Laxer 70). Many global elites have been educated at American universities in American capitalism, an approach of cultural proliferation used by the Roman Empire (Laxer 71). The United States also has physical forms of disembodied rulership in covert militaries, such as the C.I.A., Navy SEALS, and others. It engages in proxy wars and secretly funds resistance movements against governments of countries that do not align with its interests, like the Reagan Administration's funding of the Contras (Laxer 82).
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            The U.S. demonstrates embodied power through the most powerful military on Earth. Knowing it could not indefinitely dominate the world economically, the U.S. increased military expenditures during the Bush Administration to ensure no other country could challenge it militarily, and defense spending was more than the following sixteen countries combined (Laxer 66). The United States has installed military bases in countries of interest around the globe that function like arms of the U.S. empire. Bases adhere to their own laws, jails, and court systems and operate effectively as <span style="font-style: italic;">states of exclusion</span> within native territories (Rafael 6-4). They are located within striking distance of metropolitan areas while remaining guarded and secretive, acting as sites for the deployment of war agents, supply and information lines, and potential delivery of nuclear attacks. Military bases are robust projections of power the United States uses during political negotiations, functioning as permanent possibilities of war because they are conduits for delivering soldiers, the agents of war. The soldier is a direct projection of military power and embodies empire, a role that cannot be understated (Rafael 6-5). 
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            Civilian men are transformed into U.S. soldiers through the stages of <span style="font-style: italic;">subjugation</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">hypermasculinization</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">collectivization</span> (Rafael 6-5). The <span style="font-style: italic;">subjugation</span> stage involves breaking down the recruit under immersive conditions. Enlisted individuals are placed within a strict structure, removing all forms of individuality and choice. They are verbally abused via feminine language, forced to work as a unit to overcome challenges under intense emotional duress, and are punished collectively for any single member's mistake. The recruit learns to sleep with his weapon, and it becomes a part of him. He takes on the character of his weapon. "By the time marksmanship training begins, your M-16 has become another limb...you have faith in its life-preserving power. 'I think that's why we sleep with our rubber duckies, sleep right beside them'" (Tietz 58). The recruit's old identity is removed, and a new one is provided through emotional bonds of shared suffering and accountability. Once the recruit has been entirely subjugated, he is ready to be weaponized through the <span style="font-style: italic;">hypermasculinization</span> stage.
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            A critical part of weaponizing the soldier requires denying all things feminine (Rafael 6-5). Femininity, as it relates to war, is associated with emotion, indecisiveness, and ambivalence. By opposing and removing what is <span style="font-style: italic;">soft</span> within the soldier, he can become hardened for action, taking on the character of his hypermasculinity: strong, emotionless, and decisive. Abjection of femininity further adds to the fundamentally ambivalent nature of the hypermasculine soldier. Because removing all feminine elements of oneself is impossible, such subjugated aspects of the soldier provide an eternal enemy, keeping him aligned toward his military indoctrination and perpetually seeking to validate his hypermasculine self.
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            As it turns out, people are not naturally inclined to kill each other (Tietz 1.) A weaponized soldier does not equate to a killing machine. The final stage of building a soldier, <span style="font-style: italic;">collectivization</span>, adds the motivating force to kill. Leveraging the intense social bonds, group loyalty, and shared identity created, soldiers experience a collective rebirth. As seen in the movie "Full Metal Jacket," from a mountaintop, Gunnery Sargeant Hartman addresses the new graduates: "Marines die. That is what we are here for. But the Marine Corps lives forever!" (Full Metal Jacket). It is this strong sense of military collectivism that turns murder into a moral obligation to protect the objectives of the group. 
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            Then, the group is given an enemy, labeled with racial and gendered terms to justify the label of <span style="font-style: italic;">Other</span> (Rafael 6-5). Each war has presented its unique racial slurs and practices used to dehumanize opponents, allowing the military collective to target the enemy for collaboration or elimination (Rafael 6-5).
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            The prostitute provides a perfect source of ambivalence for the soldier, validating his masculinity and morale through his physical and sexual domination of her. She is also the perfect threat. Externally, she threatens the soldier's physical well-being by introducing the possibility of sexually transmitted disease, as an outsider capable of stealing his possessions, and as a potential love interest that might come between him and his battalion. Internally, she reminds him of his own subjugated femininity. Therefore, the prostitute can only be objectified and never trusted (Rafael 6-6).
                          </p>
                          <p class="tab-indent">
                            The prostitute serves one more essential role in enforcing the group identity of soldiers. As a native and a woman, she is both a sexual object and a symbolic object of the ambivalent, codependent nature of the empire. She is a slave to the initiation rituals of soldiers performed in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Rest and Recreation</span> areas of the Military Prostitution Complex (Rafael 6-6). Being used in this way, the native prostitute serves to bolster soldier identity as a sacrifice to the sexual imperialism of the West (Sturdevant 326).
